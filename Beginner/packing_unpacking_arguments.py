Packing and unpacking of arguments: 

Packing refers to combining multiple values into a single data structure 
(like a tuple). Unpacking is the process of extracting values from a data structure 
and assigning them to individual variables. For function arguments, 
*args is used to pack arguments into a tuple, 
while **kwargs is used to pack keyword arguments into a dictionary.
